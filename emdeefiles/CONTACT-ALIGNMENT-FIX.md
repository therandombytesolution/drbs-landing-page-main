# Contact Section Alignment Fix

## Issue
The contact cards (Phone, Email, Live Chat) were misaligned due to varying content heights, particularly the email card which had a longer email address causing it to be taller than the other cards.

## Solution Applied

### CSS Changes to `crypto-theme.css`

#### 1. Contact Card Container
```css
.contact-card {
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: flex-start;
    min-height: 280px;
}
```
**Benefits:**
- Ensures all cards have equal height
- Uses flexbox for consistent vertical alignment
- Sets minimum height to prevent cards from being too short

#### 2. Contact Link Styling
```css
.contact-link {
    word-break: break-word;
    display: inline-block;
    max-width: 100%;
    line-height: 1.5;
}
```
**Benefits:**
- Prevents long email addresses from overflowing
- Ensures text wraps properly within the card
- Maintains consistent spacing

#### 3. Consistent Spacing
```css
.contact-card h5 {
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.contact-card p {
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    min-height: 24px;
}

.social-links {
    gap: 1rem;
    margin-top: 0.5rem;
}
```
**Benefits:**
- Ensures consistent spacing between elements
- Aligns content vertically across all cards
- Maintains visual balance

## Result
✅ All three contact cards now have equal height
✅ Content is properly aligned vertically
✅ Long email addresses wrap correctly
✅ Consistent spacing across all cards
✅ Professional, balanced appearance

## Testing
- Refresh the page at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
- Scroll to the "Contact Us" section
- Verify all three cards are aligned at the same height
- Check that the email address wraps properly
- Test hover effects still work correctly

**Status: Fixed ✅**
